Dear Kristian,

Our progress for this week, is as follows:
Christopher - Currently working on our database. I have already created the fields which consists of the Username, Password, Name, and
Content. Things that needs to be worked on or improved; password verification, username already exists verification, and hashing
of the passwords that are stored.

Lawrence - Currently updating the user interface of the android application and at the same time working on the raspberry pi with Patrick
to implement voice control. Also working on the GUI of the android application to maintain an up to date look that satisfies the users, 
while delivering the full functionality of the application.

Patrick - Currently working on voice control for the raspberry pi. Also working with Lawrence to allow full compatibility 
with the Android application and the voice control system.

Problem:

Database - The web host database has expired but renewed the database with a different hosting server. We will have to migrate the data from the previous database to the new host.

Voice Control - Still researching a way to run the python codes from a script as the voice control program is based of running scripts.  

Financial:

PCB - we decide to switch to a PCB to change the old setup to make it more compact as previously the setup was using a small breadboard 
to wire everything. We also had bought a stacking header as the prototype lab did not have any leftover from the last semesters
PCB creations. The price of the header was about $16, as we purchased a pack.

Voice Control - We have to purchase a USB microphone as the Raspberry PI does not have a microphone embedded into the device. 
Reason for the USB version is that, it make it more compact thus to the fact that it's a small attachment compared to a 
sound card + 3.5mm microphone. Cost for these parts is undecided since we have not decided on the parts yet. 

From,
Christopher Albarillo
