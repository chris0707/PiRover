Dear Kristian,

Our progress for this week, is as follows:
Christopher - Currently working on our database. I have already created the fields which consists of the Username, Password, Name,and
Content. Things that needs to be worked on or improved, are the password verification, username already exists verification, and hashing
of the passwords that are stored.

Lawrence - Currently updating the user interface of the android application and at the same time working on the raspberry pi with Patrick
to implement voice control. Also working on the GUI of the android application to maintain an up to date look that satisfies the users, 
while delivering the full functionality of the application.

Patrick - Currently working on voice control for the raspberry pi. Also working with Lawrence to allow full compatibility 
with the Android application and the voice control system.

From,
Christopher Albarillo
